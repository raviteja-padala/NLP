- About the Dataset:

The dataset was originally published on the UCI Machine Learning repository. 

Citation:

The research paper titled "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews Applying Cross-Domain and Cross-Data Learning," authored by Felix Gräßer, Surya Kallumadi, Hagen Malberg, and Sebastian Zaunseder. This paper was presented at the 2018 International Conference on Digital Health (DH '18) and published by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). The paper proposes a novel approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of drug reviews that applies cross-domain and cross-data learning. 

The UCI ML Drug Review dataset consists of patient reviews for different drugs, along with corresponding ratings and other information. It is often used for natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis tasks, as well as for exploring the relationships between drug reviews and patient satisfaction. The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction.

Here are some key features typically found in the UCI ML Drug Review dataset:

1. **Drug Name:** The name of the medication being reviewed.

2. **Condition:** The medical condition for which the drug was prescribed.

3. **Review:** The text of the patient's review or feedback about the drug.

4. **Rating:** A numerical rating given by the patient, often on a scale from 1 to 10, indicating their satisfaction with the drug.

5. **Date:** The date when the review was posted.

6. **Useful Count:** The number of users who found the review useful.
