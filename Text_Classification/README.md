[Medical_Text_classification_Healthcare_data.ipynb](https://github.com/raviteja-padala/NLP/blob/main/Text_Classification/Medical_Text_classification_Healthcare_data.ipynb): This project involves the development of a text classification model for automatically assigning medical specialties to transcribed medical documents. It begins with data acquisition, followed by data preprocessing to clean and prepare the text data. Text vectorization techniques are applied to convert the text into a numerical format, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on this data. The project evaluates the model's performance, reports classification metrics, and explores strategies for enhancing its accuracy. And different approches to improvise the text classification accuracy and comparitive analysis.

Predictions with the created model.



## `What is Text Classification?`

Text classification, also known as text categorization or text tagging, is the process of assigning predefined categories or labels to textual documents based on their content. The goal of text classification is to automatically classify or categorize large volumes of text data into specific categories, making it easier to organize, search, and extract meaningful insights from text documents.

## `Applications of Text Classification:`

**Spam Email Detection:** Classify emails as spam or not spam.
**Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in customer reviews or social media posts.
**Topic Classification:** Categorize news articles into topics like politics, sports, or entertainment.
**Language Identification:** Identify the language of a given text document.
**Document Routing:** Automatically route documents to the appropriate department or team based on their content.
**Content Recommendation:** Recommend articles, products, or content to users based on their interests.
