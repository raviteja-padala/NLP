- About the Dataset:
  
The UCI ML Drug Review dataset consists of patient reviews for different drugs, along with corresponding ratings and other information. It is often used for natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis tasks, as well as for exploring the relationships between drug reviews and patient satisfaction.
